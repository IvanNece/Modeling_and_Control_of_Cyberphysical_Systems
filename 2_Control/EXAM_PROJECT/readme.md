# 🚀 Distributed Control of Multi-Agent Magnetic Levitation Systems

This repository contains a modular MATLAB implementation of a distributed control system for a multi-agent network of magnetic levitation (maglev) systems.

The project is developed for the **Part II CPS course project** and focuses on:

- Cooperative tracking of a leader by multiple follower agents
- Comparison between **local** and **neighborhood** observers
- Simulation of different network topologies
- Analysis of performance under varying parameters and noise
